import Underlining from "../../../src/styles/underlining"

Hey there, I'm Cassi Gallagher-Shearer. I'm a software engineer with a passion for front-end development, UI/UX, and design.

I've been in the technology space for 11 years and a software engineer for the past 4. I've worn a lot of hats in my career from customer service, to marketing, to design. All of which have helped build on a development career passionate about the user expirience.

These days I work primarily out of the modern web space focusing on React, but have also spent time working on CMS-based development (Wordpress, Drupal, Contentful).

When I'm not coding, you'll probably find me hiting up one of our local breweries, hanging out with my dogs, or crocheting cozy cowls.
